 The skin friction coefficient, wall heat and mass transfer rates for different values of Pr, Nb, Nt,
?, R and Le are given in Table1 when Ec = Ha = ? = 0. For some prescribed values of Ec, Ha,
? and Rex together with the other embedded parameters and numbers, some fluid dynamic
quantities were presented. For clarity, let us see the effects of parameters like Brownian motion,
thermophoresis, viscous dissipation, thermal radiation, scaled chemical reaction and Lewis
number, magnetic parameter, Prandtl number and Eckert number on various fluid dynamic
quantities as presented graphically and in tabular form.
